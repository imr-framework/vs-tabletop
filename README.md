Virtual Scanner Tabletop is an extension to [Virtual Scanner](https://github.com/imr-framework/virtual-scanner/) comprising of educational games about MRI that can be run by simulation or connected to a real educational MRI scanner. Target audience include high school, college, and post-grad students as well as members of the MR and scientific community at large.   

## Quickstart
### Method 1: `pip install`
1. On the command line, make a new virtual environment using the command: `python -m venv myenv` For more info on creating virtual environments,
see [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html]). Activate the virtual environment using the command `source venv/bin/activate` on the terminal from the folder where you installed the virtual environment
2. Install the games using the command: 'pip install vs-tabletop'
3. cd into the main folder called "vstabletop" (`venv\Lib\site-packages\vstabletop`) and run `app.py`. Click into the link in the program output (examplee: http://127.0.0.1:5000/). Log in as `admin` using password `123456`.
   
#### Troubleshooting 
(version 1.0.0b5) - You might encounter problems with installing Kiwisolver which requires Visual C++. If you have trouble getting the Visual C++, you can ignore the kiwisolver and perform the following steps:
1. Install vs-tabletop without dependencies: `pip install vs-tabletop==1.0.0b4 --no-deps`
2. After it's installed, find `requirements.txt` in the `vstabletop` folder and remove the `kiwisolver==1.0.1` line
3. Install the rest of the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run `app.py` the same way as described above. The games should be able to run normally.

### Method 2: Cloning 
1. Clone the repository.
2. Make a virtual environment as described in Method 1, activate it, and install everything specified in `requirements.txt`
3. `cd` into the app directory and run `questions.py` to set up the database.
4. Run the app in one of two ways:
   (a) Run `app.py` using Pycharm or other IDE, or on the command line with `python app.py`
   (b) On the command line, set the FLASK_APP variable (`set FLASK_APP=app` on Windows, or `export FLASK_APP=app` on non-Windows). Then run the app with: `flask run`
5. Click into the link in the program output (example: http://127.0.0.1:5000/) or copy & paste it into the browser. Log in as admin using password `123456`.
